    "Let us consider $g(w) = w_k(t)+\\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t)[x(t)-w_k(t)]$, where $\\alpha \\in ]0,1[$ represents the learning rate. So, $g'(w) = 1 - \\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t)$. The fixed point method says that if $0 < max |g'(w)| < 1$, $g$ has an unique fixed point in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $w_k = g(w_{k-1})$, with $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ converges to that unique fixed point, $\\forall w_0$ (initial approximation considered). So, the condition we have is: $0 < max |1 - \\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t)| < 1$. Now, we will prove it. We know that $max |1 - \\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t)|$ is achieved when $\\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t)$ is minimum. We also know that $h_{ck}(t) = exp(-||r_k - r_c||^2 / \\sigma(t) ^2) = \\frac{1}{exp(||r_k - r_c||^2 / \\sigma(t) ^2)}$. Obviously, $h_{ck}(t) > 0$. The maximum of $h_{ck}(t)$ is achieved when $r_k = r_c$, meaning that the maximum of the function is 1. For this reason, $h_{ck}(t) \\in ]0,1]$. As we are interested to get $max |1 - \\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t)|$, we need to give $\\alpha(t)$ and $h_{ck}(t)$ very small values, very close to zero. Also, we can see that $\\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t) \\neq 1$, $\\forall \\alpha(t), h_{ck}(t)$. From here we get that $0 < max |1 - \\alpha(t)h_{ck}(t)| < 1$, with $w \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In this way, the convergence is guaranteed."
